**Data and viz of interest**
1. [Education big data and learning analytics: a bibliometric analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02176-x)
* I am interested in this article because I have never heard of analytics being used in an education setting and would like to learn how analytics could enhance and improve education
2. I am interested in this data visualization because I am intereted in visualizing data with maps. I find geography to be interesting and would like to learn more visualizations using maps.

<b>Ideas from curated datasets & project lists</b>
Dataset | Description | Link
---|---|---
Marvel Comic Book and Characters | Dataset includes all comic books and characters in marvel and it would be interesting to look at how historical events in the U.S. shaped and influenced the creation of characters. | [Marvel Comic Book and Characters](https://developer.marvel.com/)
Individual Household Electric Power Consumption | Dataset includes measurements of electric power consumption in one household over 4 years. I want to analyze the data to see how electricity usage changes throughout the year and how it is affected by events occurring throughout the 4 years. | [Individual Household Electric Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
